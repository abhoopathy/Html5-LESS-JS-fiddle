CSS-HTML-LESS Fiddle
====================

Love jsfiddle.net, but wish you could use vim, less, and your own
template? This makes it easy to set that up. It'll clone the template,
open up the index.html, main.js, and main.less in vim (a la jsfiddle),
and open index.html in your default browser.

How To
---------------------
